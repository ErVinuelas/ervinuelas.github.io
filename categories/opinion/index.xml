hometown, Badajoz (Spain), to visit my loved ones and enjoy some time at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the long hours of the trip, I usually enjoy most of it and the 14-17
hours I spend leave a lot of room for reflexions and facing my own
thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last hours of the trip, while I was crossing the usual mediterranean
forests of Spain, I realized how lucky I am. Although it is a long trip, the mere
fact that I can combine on a sigle day at least four different types of public
transport, go through four countries and manage to travel more than 2700km makes
me realise how well coordinated our society (the european) is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overview of the journey is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Woke up at 5:00 AM, had some breakfast and headed to my nearest bus stop to
catch the 5:20 bus that dropped me at the Aarhus train station.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hopped in a train at 6:00(god, I love danish trains) and arrived to
Copenhagen&amp;rsquo;s airport at 9:35.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right on time to catch my 11:05 flight to Madrid, a flight that arrived at
the promised time of 14:35.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I took the regional train to Madrid train station and grabbed some lunch
on the go. Here is a picture of the beautiful architecture at this station.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train to Badajoz left at 16:38 and is expected to arrive at 21:00.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the beauty of it is that, not only every single mean of transport arrived
on time, but also the infrastructure that surrounds each of them. For example,
when I left Aarhus at a very early hour, the coffe shop of the station was
already up a running so the average commuter can grab a coffe and start working
from the comfort of the train. Or the fact that anytime I needed to use the
bathroom there was one at a less than a minute walk (and very clean btw). Or the
variety of lunch options I had just at a 10 min walk from Madrid Atocha train
station. You get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This make the travel so much easier and uneventful. I spent most of my time of
the time working, reading or looking through the window, activities that I would
have done anyway or that I enjoy. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I have wasted my time today, as
it is the case when I have to drive or share a car. Those time I can spend from
2 to 4 hours just sitting and looking at a line of asphalt, hopefully with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end there is always room for improvement, specially regarding the public
transport network in Spain of medium size cities as mine. But I think we, as a
society, should be proud of what we accomplished so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
