&gt;SAT/SMT/AR summer school&lt;/a&gt; in Nancy, France. It was a very intense experience, I had the opportunity to learn about some of the ongoing research and the latest challenges in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all the lectures were very interesting, I have to admit that the ones given by &lt;a class="link" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Haniel Barbosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lri.fr/~keller/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Chantal Keller&lt;/a&gt; were the ones I enjoyed the most, since those were the ones that were more related to my bachelor thesis. Besides, I had the opportunity to meet a lot of colleagues who were doing research on the topics of the school, which was a very enriching experience from a professional and personal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of us, after a nice lunch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed the oportunity of visiting Nancy as a city(wow! what a square they have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to thank the organization committee for accepting me as a participant and for making the effort of hosting 2024 edition of the school.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
