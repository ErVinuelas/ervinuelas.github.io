[{"content":"I consider myself passionate about science, especially Mathematics, and I have also developed a huge interest in Computer Science since I began my university studies. My passion for knowledge led me to study a both the bachelors of Mathematics and Computer Science. I proudly finished my studies at Universidad Complutense de Madrid on June 2024.\nBoth my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s Degree Final Projects are about software verification, one using the Dafny language and the other using the Rocq Proof Assistant. This topic is among my preferred areas of discourse but I also enjoy other topics, such as Cryptography or Machine Learning. I really enjoy working in the intersection of math and computer science.\nThat is why I decided to study a Master of Computer Science at Aarhus University and specialize in the before mentioned subjects. I am really enjoying my time here in Denmark.\nIn the past I have worked as a student assistant in the AI\u0026amp;ML department of Salling Group. I learnt a lot during my time there and spend most of my time in a project which aimed to reduce the theft in the shops. We used different approaches, but I mainly focused on aplying CNNs and other Deep Learning techniques. Right now I am working as a research assistant under the guidance of Bas Spitters in a project for the Ethereum Foundation.\nOn my spare time, I like to practice judo (for the last 17 years!) and recently started to do some climbing. I also enjoy a good book and a tasty meal.\n","date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/about-me/","title":"About me"},{"content":"I am writing this post as a summary of some questions I usually get from students who are considering coming to pursue a Master\u0026rsquo;s or Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree at Aarhus University. I hope people can benefit from it, and get some answers to the questions we have all asked ourselves when thinking about moving to another country to study. I will keep updating it when I come up with new things that I consider relevant.\nEverything written here is my opinion and/or experiences, and I will try to avoid writing about facts that can be easily checked with a quick internet check.\nThe city itself Let\u0026rsquo;s start talking about the city. Coming from a 5 years of Bachelor in Madrid, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like moving to another big city, so I only considered medium size (less than 500k inhabitants) cities. Aarhus is the right size for me, a city you can cross in a 30 min ride.\nBut it is also a vibrant city. Thanks to the university, a lot of young people choose to live here (the average age is 26 wtf!). It is also due to the university that there is a hectic international vibe. There are plenty of events for internationals, there is always something to do during the weekend.\nRegarding transport, there is a very punctual and frequent public transport system. Nevertheless, people usually move around with their bikes since there is a dense and and well preserved network of bike paths. Also, getting a bike is quite cheap. You can get them from 500dkk (~60 eur) in the second hand market or you can rent them from 140 dkk (~20 euro) a month.\nSports Based on my experience and the people around me, I think doing sports in Aarhus is quite cheap, even when compared with Spain. I am a member of a judo club and a climbing association, and the sum costs me around 6k dkk(~800 euro) a year. You will usually also have a gym at your dorm or if you prefer open spaces, there are a lot of parks and green areas where you can let go some steam by either running or going to the calisthenics zone.\nHealthcare It is universal and free, which means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay and you get everything you need(nice!), except for stuff like dentists or physiotherapy sessions. Anyway, I had to make use of it and the experience was smooth and as nice as it could have been. They took care of me and I felt safe all the way, which I think is important when you are in a foreign country.\nSU and working Basically, if you are an EU citizen and work for at least 10/12 hours a week, you get a grant from the state of 4k dkk (~600 euros), after taxes, every month. There are some rules around it, but that is basically it. HUGE perk in my opinion.\nOf course, you still need to get a job for it. I think landing a studies-relevant student part time job is not difficult, if you are a CS student. Otherwise it is not so easy, take it into account. After the first six months, all my CS fellow international friends were able to get a job.\nHousing Unlike in other places in Europe, getting an apartment here is quite easy and cheap. I got mine 2 months before arriving here, through the university website. I share a kitchen with other students, but I have my own bathroom and bedroom(with furniture). You can pay from 300 to 500, depending on your preferences.\nHere is the link to the place where I live, I think the gallery represents quite faithfully how the rooms are.\nLife I also get questioned a lot regarding how easy it is to meet people. As I said, there is a solid portion of the students who are international and easy to approach since they also are new and want to make new friends. I would reccommend attending the events promoted from the International Office, since it is an easy way to meet new people.\nBut I think most people meet their group of friends either at their dorm, at class or by joining some sports club. Those are also the best ways to start to make some danish friends, outside these eviroments I would say it is more difficult to approach the locals.\nThere is a concept, which I think is common accross Denmark, that is the Friday bar. Basically, every Friday, each department has a bar that is organized by students with usually very cheap prices. It is where students usually meet for a beer, or two, or three\u0026hellip;\nDepending of what you like, there is a Friday bar for you. Computer Science is known for being quite chill and as a good starter of the night, whereas Medicine or BSS are more like a proper night club.\nThe university The teaching style depends on the classes but it usually consists of a mix of theoretical classes and then exercise classes where you apply what you learnt in class. Depending on the subject, you might get assignments or projects, team projects are a constant throughout the master, it is a very popular format.\nMost of the exams are oral, which was a new format for me. It usually consists of a presentation and some afterwards questions. It may seem intimidating, but you get used to it and nowadays I actually prefer it.\n","date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/about-aarhus/","title":"Aarhus for an international CS student"},{"content":"Today I once again traveled from the city where I live, Aarhus (Denmark), to my hometown, Badajoz (Spain), to visit my loved ones and enjoy some time at home.\nDespite the long hours of the trip, I usually enjoy most of it and the 14-17 hours I spend leave a lot of room for reflexions and facing my own thoughts.\nOn the last hours of the trip, while I was crossing the usual mediterranean forests of Spain, I realized how lucky I am. Although it is a long trip, the mere fact that I can combine on a sigle day at least four different types of public transport, go through four countries and manage to travel more than 2700km makes me realise how well coordinated our society (the european) is.\nThe overview of the journey is as follows:\nWoke up at 5:00 AM, had some breakfast and headed to my nearest bus stop to catch the 5:20 bus that dropped me at the Aarhus train station. Hopped in a train at 6:00(god, I love danish trains) and arrived to Copenhagen\u0026rsquo;s airport at 9:35. Right on time to catch my 11:05 flight to Madrid, a flight that arrived at the promised time of 14:35. Then I took the regional train to Madrid train station and grabbed some lunch on the go. Here is a picture of the beautiful architecture at this station. The train to Badajoz left at 16:38 and is expected to arrive at 21:00. Now, the beauty of it is that, not only every single mean of transport arrived on time, but also the infrastructure that surrounds each of them. For example, when I left Aarhus at a very early hour, the coffe shop of the station was already up a running so the average commuter can grab a coffe and start working from the comfort of the train. Or the fact that anytime I needed to use the bathroom there was one at a less than a minute walk (and very clean btw). Or the variety of lunch options I had just at a 10 min walk from Madrid Atocha train station. You get the point.\nThis make the travel so much easier and uneventful. I spent most of my time of the time working, reading or looking through the window, activities that I would have done anyway or that I enjoy. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I have wasted my time today, as it is the case when I have to drive or share a car. Those time I can spend from 2 to 4 hours just sitting and looking at a line of asphalt, hopefully with music.\nIn the end there is always room for improvement, specially regarding the public transport network in Spain of medium size cities as mine. But I think we, as a society, should be proud of what we accomplished so far.\n","date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/aarhus-badajoz/cercanias_hu_ff0a0d6ac61cd038.jpeg","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/aarhus-badajoz/","title":"From Aarhus to Badajoz"},{"content":"This summer I attended the SAT/SMT/AR summer school in Nancy, France. It was a very intense experience, I had the opportunity to learn about some of the ongoing research and the latest challenges in the field.\nAlthough all the lectures were very interesting, I have to admit that the ones given by Haniel Barbosa and Chantal Keller were the ones I enjoyed the most, since those were the ones that were more related to my bachelor thesis. Besides, I had the opportunity to meet a lot of colleagues who were doing research on the topics of the school, which was a very enriching experience from a professional and personal way.\nHere is a photo of us, after a nice lunch:\nI also enjoyed the oportunity of visiting Nancy as a city(wow! what a square they have).\nFinally, I would like to thank the organization committee for accepting me as a participant and for making the effort of hosting 2024 edition of the school.\n","date":"2024-07-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/sat-smt-ar/sat-smt-ar_hu_57f454a32c82b3a1.jpeg","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/sat-smt-ar/","title":"SAT-SMT-AR summer school"}]
