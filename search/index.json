[{"content":"I consider myself passionate about science, especially Mathematics, and I have also developed a huge interest in Computer Science since I began my university studies. My passion for knowledge led me to study a both the bachelors of Mathematics and Computer Science. I proudly finished my studies at Universidad Complutense de Madrid on June 2024.\nBoth my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s Degree Final Projects are about software verification, one using the Dafny language and the other using the Rocq Proof Assistant. This topic is among my preferred areas of discourse but I also enjoy other topics, such as Cryptography or Machine Learning. I really enjoy working in the intersection of math and computer science.\nThat is why I decided to study a Master of Computer Science at Aarhus University and specialize in the before mentioned subjects. I am really enjoying my time here in Denmark.\nIn the past I have worked as a student assistant in the AI\u0026amp;ML department of Salling Group. I learnt a lot during my time there and spend most of my time in a project which aimed to reduce the theft in the shops. We used different approaches, but I mainly focused on aplying CNNs and other Deep Learning techniques. Right now I am working as a research assistant under the guidance of Bas Spitters in a project for the Ethereum Foundation.\nOn my spare time, I like to practice judo (for the last 17 years!) and recently started to do some climbing. I also enjoy a good book and a tasty meal.\n","date":"2025-03-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/about-me/","title":"About me"},{"content":"Today I once again traveled from the city where I live, Aarhus (Denmark), to my hometown, Badajoz (Spain), to visit my loved ones and enjoy some time at home.\nDespite the long hours of the trip, I usually enjoy most of it and the 14-17 hours I spend leave a lot of room for reflexions and facing my own thoughts.\nOn the last hours of the trip, while I was crossing the usual mediterranean forests of Spain, I realized how lucky I am. Although it is a long trip, the mere fact that I can combine on a sigle day at least four different types of public transport, go through four countries and manage to travel more than 2700km makes me realise how well coordinated our society (the european) is.\nThe overview of the journey is as follows:\nWoke up at 5:00 AM, had some breakfast and headed to my nearest bus stop to catch the 5:20 bus that dropped me at the Aarhus train station. Hopped in a train at 6:00(god, I love danish trains) and arrived to Copenhagen\u0026rsquo;s airport at 9:35. Right on time to catch my 11:05 flight to Madrid, a flight that arrived at the promised time of 14:35. Then I took the regional train to Madrid train station and grabbed some lunch on the go. Here is a picture of the beautiful architecture at this station. The train to Badajoz left at 16:38 and is expected to arrive at 21:00. Now, the beauty of it is that, not only every single mean of transport arrived on time, but also the infrastructure that surrounds each of them. For example, when I left Aarhus at a very early hour, the coffe shop of the station was already up a running so the average commuter can grab a coffe and start working from the comfort of the train. Or the fact that anytime I needed to use the bathroom there was one at a less than a minute walk (and very clean btw). Or the variety of lunch options I had just at a 10 min walk from Madrid Atocha train station. You get the point.\nThis make the travel so much easier and uneventful. I spent most of my time of the time working, reading or looking through the window, activities that I would have done anyway or that I enjoy. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I have wasted my time today, as it is the case when I have to drive or share a car. Those time I can spend from 2 to 4 hours just sitting and looking at a line of asphalt, hopefully with music.\nIn the end there is always room for improvement, specially regarding the public transport network in Spain of medium size cities as mine. But I think we, as a society, should be proud of what we accomplished so far.\n","date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/aarhus-badajoz/cercanias_hu_ff0a0d6ac61cd038.jpeg","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/aarhus-badajoz/","title":"From Aarhus to Badajoz"},{"content":"This summer I attended the SAT/SMT/AR summer school in Nancy, France. It was a very intense experience, I had the opportunity to learn about some of the ongoing research and the latest challenges in the field.\nAlthough all the lectures were very interesting, I have to admit that the ones given by Haniel Barbosa and Chantal Keller were the ones I enjoyed the most, since those were the ones that were more related to my bachelor thesis. Besides, I had the opportunity to meet a lot of colleagues who were doing research on the topics of the school, which was a very enriching experience from a professional and personal way.\nHere is a photo of us, after a nice lunch:\nI also enjoyed the oportunity of visiting Nancy as a city(wow! what a square they have).\nFinally, I would like to thank the organization committee for accepting me as a participant and for making the effort of hosting 2024 edition of the school.\n","date":"2024-07-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/sat-smt-ar/sat-smt-ar_hu_57f454a32c82b3a1.jpeg","permalink":"https://ervinuelas.github.io/p/sat-smt-ar/","title":"SAT-SMT-AR summer school"}]
