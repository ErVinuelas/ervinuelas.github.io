I consider myself passionate about science, especially Mathematics, and I have also developed a huge interest in Computer Science since I began my university studies. My passion for knowledge led me to study a double major, and now a Master in Computer Science at [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk/).

Both my Bachelor's Degree Final Projects are about software verification, [one](https://github.com/ErVinuelas/verification-segments) using the [Dafny](https://dafny.org/) language and the [other](https://github.com/costa-group/termination_coq) using the [Rocq Proof Assistant](https://rocq-prover.org/). This topic is among my preferred areas of discourse, but I am receptive to engaging in discussions on other topics as well, such as Cryptography, Machine Learning and Data Science. This three topics are the ones I have chosen to specialize in.

I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual with a proven ability to work independently and as part of a team. My international stays have taught me how to be an independent person with communication skills, capable of adapting to new environments.

Besides, I have been practicing judo for over 15 years, during that time I have achieved to win numerous regional competitions, and even competed at different national and international tournaments, obtaining favorable results. My dedication to judo has instilled me discipline, perseverance, and a strong respect for others.
