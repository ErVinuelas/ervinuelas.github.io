I consider myself passionate about science, especially Mathematics, and I have also developed a huge interest in Computer Science since I began my university studies. My passion for knowledge led me to study a both the bachelors of Mathematics and Computer Science. I proudly finished my studies at Universidad Complutense de Madrid on June 2024.

Both my Bachelor's Degree Final Projects are about software verification, [one](https://github.com/ErVinuelas/verification-segments) using the [Dafny](https://dafny.org/) language and the [other](https://github.com/costa-group/termination_coq) using the [Rocq Proof Assistant](https://rocq-prover.org/). This topic is among my preferred areas of discourse but I also enjoy other topics, such as Cryptography or Machine Learning. I really enjoy working in the intersection of math and computer science.

That is why I decided to study a Master of Computer Science at Aarhus University and specialize in the before mentioned subjects. I am really enjoying my time here in Denmark.

In the past I have worked as a student assistant in the AI&ML department of Salling Group. I learnt a lot during my time there and spend most of my time in a project which aimed to reduce the theft in the shops. We used different approaches, but I mainly focused on aplying CNNs and other Deep Learning techniques. Right now I am working as a research assistant under the guidance of [Bas Spitters](https://users-cs.au.dk/spitters/) in a project for the [Ethereum Foundation](https://verified-zkevm.org).

On my spare time, I like to practice judo (for the last 17 years!) and recently started to do some climbing. I also enjoy a good book and a tasty meal.
